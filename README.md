🚀 AI-Powered Resume Analysis & Intelligent Job Recommendation System

An AI-driven full-stack web application that analyzes resumes, identifies skill gaps, calculates ATS compatibility scores, and provides intelligent job recommendations using Large Language Models (LLMs).

📌 About The Project

This project was developed as part of the Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship 6.0 (8 Weeks).

The system is designed to solve a real-world recruitment problem —
manual resume screening and inefficient job matching.

Instead of traditional evaluation, the platform uses AI-powered structured analysis to generate:

Clear strength & weakness insights

Section-wise resume scoring

Skill gap detection

Personalized learning suggestions

Intelligent resume–job match recommendations

✨ Core Features

Secure User Authentication with bcrypt password hashing

Resume Upload (PDF & DOCX supported)

AI-based Resume Content Analysis

ATS Compatibility Score Calculation

Section-wise Score Breakdown

Advanced Skill Gap Analysis

Personalized Learning Recommendations

Dynamic Job Scraping using Selenium

Intelligent Resume–Job Match Percentage

Personalized Job Recommendations Dashboard

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: Streamlit
Backend: Python
AI & NLP: LangChain + Large Language Models (LLMs)
Web Scraping: Selenium
Database: MongoDB / SQLite
Security: bcrypt (secure password hashing)
File Processing: PyPDF2, python-docx

⚙️ How It Works

Step 1: User registers and logs in securely
Step 2: Resume is uploaded (PDF/DOCX)
Step 3: Text is extracted and cleaned
Step 4: LLM analyzes resume using structured prompt engineering
Step 5: System generates:

Resume score

Strengths & weaknesses

Skill gap insights

Step 6: Job listings are scraped dynamically
Step 7: Resume–job relevance score is calculated
Step 8: Personalized job recommendations are displayed
